1st simulation:
Stockout ≈ 0.2%

Avg inventory ≈ 3500+

Very safe, very wasteful

2nd simulation:
INITIAL_INVENTORY = 600 REORDER_POINT = 379, ORDER_QUANTITY = 300
Stockout Probability : 3.4%
Average Inventory    : 2449.81
-- reduced average inventory by ~30%
--stockout risk increased, but still reasonable
